# Public code for the OOSA course.

There is a separate directory for each week's work. As we progress, suggested answers will be uploaded.


## Foundations

The **foundations** folder contains some warm up exercises to transition on to the course. There are two folders within:

* basic\_features
* iterating

The basic\_features folder contains a set of scripts introducing the basic Python features (data types, loops, plotting etc.). Other than **06_objects.py**, which will be covered in week 2, these should already be familar to you and are included here for revision.

The **iterating** directory contains some exercises to practice using loops and work up to moving around a raster dataset.


## Week 1

Week 1 covers:

***Aspects***
* Github version control and code repository
* Computer basics 
* Revision of loops and file I/O

***Algorithm***
* Introduction to algorithm design: Finding minima and sorting


### fileIO

Contains two scripts to demonstrate reading from a text file and writing to a text file. The ***data*** folder contains the data for the file reading example.


### data

Contains a text file with some sample data to practice reading with the fileIO code.


### sort

Contains an example solution for a simple sort. Note that there are multiple sort solutions, such as bubble sort, and then many more complex and efficient algorithms.
