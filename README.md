# Public code for the OOSA course.

There is a separate directory for each week's work. As we progress, suggested answers will be uploaded.


## Foundations

The **foundations** folder contains some warm up exercises to transition on to the course. There are two folders within:

* basic\_features
* iterating

The basic\_features folder contains a set of scripts introducing the basic Python features (data types, loops, plotting etc.). Other than **06_objects.py**, which will be covered in week 2, these should already be familar to you and are included here for revision.

The **iterating** directory contains some exercises to practice using loops and work up to moving around a raster dataset.


## Week 1

Week 1 covers:

***Aspects***
* Github version control and code repository
* Computer basics 
* Revision of loops and file I/O

***Algorithm***
* Introduction to algorithm design: Finding minima and sorting


### fileIO

Contains two scripts to demonstrate reading from a text file and writing to a text file. The ***data*** folder contains the data for the file reading example.


### data

Contains a text file with some sample data to practice reading with the fileIO code.


### sort

Contains an example solution for a simple sort algorithm. Note that there are multiple sort solutions, such as bubble sort, and then many more complex and efficient algorithms.



## Week 2

Week 2 covers

***Aspects***
* Using the command line to make programmable programs
* Objects and classes

***Algorithm***
* Binary search: Loop and recursion


### main

Contains an example of the main block in order to ease importing code in to other programs



### command\_line

Contains two example python files, which can be used to alter the behaviour of a program at run time. This allows you to create a single python program and then reuse it with different input files, options etc.

    commandExample.py: Minimum workable example of a command line
    commandLineIllus.py: Illustrates the common command

The options for commandLineIllus.py are:

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --input INNAME        Input filename Default=test.txt
    --lat LAT             Latitude in degrees Default = 5
    --max_vcf MAXVCF      Maximum VCF value to use Default = 100
    --useSnow             Use snow switch Default = False
    -p [POW_BEAM_LIST ...], --power_beams [POW_BEAM_LIST ...] Track numbers of power beams Default = 5 and 6



### objects

Includes a script with a simple example of an object; a grouping of data and functions.


### data

Contains some text data files for use in this week's exercises.



### docu\_strings

Contains a piece of code demonstrating the suggested use of document string comments.


### binary\_search

Contains a suggested answer for week 2's algorithm. A suggested method using both looping and recursion is given.

    searchObject.py:            begins an object for sorting data
    searchObject_withplot.py:   the above with an plotting function added
    binarySearches.py:          contains suggested answers for binary search by loop and recursion
    finishedQuartiles.py:       uses the above to find quartiles in a sorted dataset
    makeData.py:                makes data for testing algorithms
    randomWages.py:             generates random wage data for testing algorithms



## Week 3

Week 3 covers

***Aspects***
* Geospatial packages: pyproj and gdal
* A note on function input/output
* Function fitting
* A mention of pandas

***Algorithm***
* Douglas-Peucker line generalization


### docu\_strings

Contains examples of document strings.


### reproject

Shows an example of using the dgal package to reproject raster or vector data.


### function\_fit

Shows an example of fitting a function to data.


### pointer\_reference

Demonstrates the difference between variables that point to an array and copying a whole array.


### pandas

Shows an example of reading data into a pandas object.


### line\_distance

A function to find the orthogonal distance between a line and a point, to be used in the Douglas-Peucker line generalization algorithm.

### dp-line-general

Contains an example solution for the Douglas-Peucker line generalisation.


## Week 4

Week 4 covers

***Aspects***
* Geospatial data formats; HDF5


### hdf

This folder contains some starter code to handle HDF5 formatted data from the LVIS lidar.

    lvisClass.py -   The base class to read LVIS data into RAM
    lvisExample.py - An example of using lvisClass.py
    processLVIS.py - Inherits from lvisClass.py and adds methods to extract ground elevation
    lvisCompleteExample.py - example solutions for the week 4 tasks

Takes the following input parameters

    --input INNAME     LVIS input filename
    --outRoot OUTROOT  Output filename root to use with graphs and DEMs produced.



## Week 5

Week 5 covers

***Aspects***
* Geopandas
* Raster-vector calculations
* Machine learning

***Algorithm***
* Batch processing: Raster-vector intersection


### Geopandas

A simple example of reading in a list of points, reprojecting and writing to a shapefile is contained in:

    week5/geopandas/geopandasExample.py

The command line options are:

    --inEpsg INEPSG    Input EPSG code
    --outEpsg OUTEPSG  Output EPSG code
    --input INNAME     Input filename
    --output OUTNAME   Output filename


### Raster-vector calculations

An example script to pass an array of x and y coordinates along with an array of data (such as ground elevation from processLVIS) and create a geotiff. The script is in:

    week5/geotiff/tiffExample.py

This contains a function, which must be called to rasterise data and write a geotiff. Note that some newer packages offer the same functionality.



# Dependencies

The code in these repositories make use of the following packages and is all in python3:

    numpy
    matplotlib.pylot
    h5py
    pyproj
    gdal
