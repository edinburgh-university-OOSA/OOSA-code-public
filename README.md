# Public code for the OOSA course.

There is a separate directory for each week's work. As we progress, suggested answers will be uploaded.


## Foundations

The **foundations** folder contains some warm up exercises to transition on to the course. There are two folders within:

* basic\_features
* iterating

The basic\_features folder contains a set of scripts introducing the basic Python features (data types, loops, plotting etc.). Other than **06_objects.py**, which will be covered in week 2, these should already be familar to you and are included here for revision.

The **iterating** directory contains some exercises to practice using loops and work up to moving around a raster dataset.


## Week 1

Week 1 covers:

***Aspects***
* Github version control and code repository
* Computer basics 
* Revision of loops and file I/O

***Algorithm***
* Introduction to algorithm design: Finding minima and sorting


### fileIO

Contains two scripts to demonstrate reading from a text file and writing to a text file. The ***data*** folder contains the data for the file reading example.


### data

Contains a text file with some sample data to practice reading with the fileIO code.


### sort

Contains an example solution for a simple sort algorithm. Note that there are multiple sort solutions, such as bubble sort, and then many more complex and efficient algorithms.



## Week 2

Week 2 covers

***Aspects***
* Using the command line to make programmable programs
* Objects and classes

***Algorithm***
* Binary search: Loop and recursion


### main

Contains an example of the main block in order to ease importing code in to other programs



### command\_line

Contains two example python files, which can be used to alter the behaviour of a program at run time. This allows you to create a single python program and then reuse it with different input files, options etc.

    commandExample.py: Minimum workable example of a command line
    commandLineIllus.py: Illustrates the common command


### objects

Includes a script with a simple example of an object; a grouping of data and functions.


### data

Contains some text data files for use in this week's exercises.



### docu\_strings

Contains a piece of code demonstrating the suggested use of document string comments.
